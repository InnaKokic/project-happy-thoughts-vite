# Happy Thoughts

In this week's project, I have to practiced my React state skills by fetching and posting data to an API.

### The Problem

To understand the useEffect() hook I watched several videos on Youtube and used the examples to help build up my porject. When I got stuck I looked for questions on StackOverflow and used chatGPT to solve the issues. One problem I had was to clear the input field after the new message had been sent. I tried looking at my prevoius projects to see how to manage it, but when that didn't work I used chatGPT and got a new block of code that worked.

If I had more time I would change some of the design, but couldn't this time because the assignment was to follow the example design as closely as possible. There is also a error message in the console about a missing "key" prop in RecentThoughts and could not figure out where the key is missing. If I had more time I would try to fix that as well.
